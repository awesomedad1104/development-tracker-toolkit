This tracker was built using the open-source [Local Development Tracker Toolkit](https://local-development-tracker-toolkit.netlify.app/), built by [Jimmy McBroom](https://github.com/jmcbroom) and Kate Abbey-Lambertz, with design support from [Lindsay Farris](https://www.farrislindsay.com/) and funding from the [Reynolds Journalism Institute](https://rjionline.org/). 

It was modified and enhanced by David Shine on behalf of Oviedo Community News to display the Oviedo/Winter Springs area.
